This will allow us to see how our model is doing.\n",

    "* Generate a new set of data with 1000 points using $y=x^2$ plus normal random noise like in the beginning. Split the data into 75% training examples and 25% test examples. You don't need to shuffe the data, just split it into two parts.

The training arrays should contain the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of 75% of data-points while the test arrays should contain the remaining 25%. We will use the training samples to train the model, and the test pair to see how our model is doing on data that it has not seen before (the test data). This is a standard method for avoiding the mistake of making models that work really well during development, but then work very badly when they see data they have never seen before.\n",
